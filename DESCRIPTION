Description: A set of tools to analyze and visualize the relationships between host-associated microbiomes of hybrid organisms and those of their progenitor species. Though not necessary, installing the microViz package is recommended as a check for phyloseq objects. To install microViz from R Universe use the following command: install.packages("microViz", repos = c(davidbarnett = "https://david-barnett.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos"))). To install microViz from GitHub use the following commands: install.packages("devtools") followed by devtools::install_github("david-barnett/microViz").
